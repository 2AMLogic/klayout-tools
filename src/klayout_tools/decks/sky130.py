"""sky130 DRC deck: a curated subset of the official rule set.

Layer/datatype pairs and rule thresholds below are transcribed from the
official, community-maintained sky130 KLayout DRC deck and layer map,
fetched directly from the canonical source repository for this issue:

- ``sky130/klayout/sky130.lydrc`` (the DRC-DSL rule script)
- ``sky130/klayout/sky130.lyt`` (the layer map / layer-properties technology
  file, which defines the ``name.purpose : layer/datatype`` pairs used below,
  e.g. ``poly.drawing : 66/20``)

both from https://github.com/fossi-foundation/open-pdks (the current home of
the repo historically known as ``open_pdks``/``RTimothyEdwards/open_pdks``;
distributed under GPLv3). Each rule's docstring cites the exact source line
(rule id and comment) it was transcribed from, so values can be re-verified
against a fresh checkout of that file at any time.

This is *not* a full transcription of the official deck (hundreds of rules
across dozens of layers) — see the "Scope guard" section of issue #9: a
curated starter subset spanning width/space/enclosure checks across
poly/diff/li1/met1/licon1/mcon, wide enough to prove the deck-adapter shape
(:class:`~klayout_tools.decks.DrcRule`) and produce a non-trivial worked
example. Coverage is expected to grow incrementally in follow-on issues.

Two rules below (``poly.width.1`` is not one of them) approximate an
official rule defined on a *compound* layer expression (a union of two mask
layers) as a check against a single drawn layer, because our engine (native
``klayout.db.Region`` check primitives — see ``docs/cli/drc.md``) checks one
layer, or one layer against one other layer, at a time; it does not evaluate
arbitrary boolean layer expressions the way the DRC-DSL script runner does.
Each such approximation is called out explicitly in its rule's docstring.

Layer numbers (verified against ``sky130.lyt``'s ``layer-map`` and the
``sky130.lydrc`` layer variable definitions, e.g. ``poly = polygons(66,
20)``):
