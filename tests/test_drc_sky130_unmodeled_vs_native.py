"""Every native sky130A DRC rule id is implemented, disclosed or untriaged (#5233).

``coverage.unmodeled_rules`` is the deck's disclosure of what a ``clean``
verdict does not cover. This test diffs the native rule-id set (a checked-in
snapshot, so it runs without an installed PDK) against the ids the curated deck
cites in rule ``provenance`` plus ``UNMODELED_RULES``. Ids in neither are
tracked in a frozen "untriaged" list that may only shrink, so a new native id
(or a removed disclosure) fails here instead of passing silently.
