# `klt extract`

Extract a **schematic-equivalent** netlist (devices + connectivity, no
parasitics) from a GDSII or OASIS layout stream, headless, and write it as a
SPICE circuit body plus a structured summary.

```
klt extract <file> --deck sky130|gf180mcu [-o|--output <netlist.spice>] [--top <cell>] [--pdk <variant>] [--pdk-root <root>] [--format text|json]
```

This is phase 2 of Epic #153 (`klt lvs`/`klt extract`), the build carried by
the accepted spike,
[`docs/design/lvs-extraction-spike.md`](../design/lvs-extraction-spike.md)
(section 2a) — read it first for the engine survey and the reasoning behind
the contract shape below. This document is the shipped contract; where the
two disagree, this document (and the code) win.

- `<file>` — path to a GDSII (`.gds`) or OASIS (`.oas`) file. KLayout
  auto-detects the stream format on read (same as `klt drc`); the extension
  is not authoritative.
- `--deck` — required. The connectivity + device-extraction deck to run.
  Currently: `sky130`, `gf180mcu`.
- `--output` / `-o` — path to write the extracted SPICE netlist. Defaults to
  `<file>` with its extension replaced by `.spice`, next to the input (the
  "next to the input" convention `klt render`/`klt sim` already use).
- `--top` — top cell to extract when the stream has more than one (required
  in that case; optional otherwise, and must name the sole top cell if
  given).
- `--pdk` / `--pdk-root` — optional. See "PDK resolution" below.
- `--format` — `text` (default, a human-readable summary) or `json`. The
  extracted **netlist** always goes to `--output`; `--format` governs only
  the summary report.

## Engine

`klt extract` runs fully headless via the pip `klayout` package's native
`klayout.db.LayoutToNetlist` (connectivity + device extraction) and
`klayout.db.NetlistSpiceWriter` (SPICE serialisation) — the same wrapped
dependency `klt drc` and `klt render` already use, verified live in the phase
1 spike. There is no dependency on the standalone `klayout` application
binary or any second geometry engine — only `pip install klayout` (already
this repo's sole runtime dependency).

Extraction is **flat**, not hierarchical: every deck layer is a single
flattened `Region`/`Texts` collection over the selected top cell (via
`Cell.begin_shapes_rec`), the same whole-layout flattening idiom `klt drc`
uses. Device recognition splits NMOS (`active - nwell`) from PMOS
(`active & nwell`) and runs KLayout's native `DeviceExtractorMOS4Transistor`
for each — one generic `nfet`/`pfet` device class per deck (no
voltage-flavor distinction).

## Deviation from the spike

The spike's proposed invocation is flag-only (`klt extract <file> --deck
sky130|gf180mcu`), with no PDK-resolver involvement. This command keeps
`--deck` as the required selector of the curated deck (self-contained,
exactly like `klt drc`'s decks — no PDK install is required to run it), and
additionally accepts optional `--pdk`/`--pdk-root` flags resolved through
the one shared resolver every other PDK-aware verb uses (`klt pdk find`'s
resolver, [`docs/cli/pdk.md`](pdk.md)), mirroring `klt sim`'s optional
`models.pdk`/`models.pdk_root` resolution. See "PDK resolution" below.

## Coverage

The `sky130` and `gf180mcu` decks are **curated starter subsets**, the
extraction analogue of `klt drc`'s curated rule decks (see
[`docs/cli/drc.md`](drc.md) → "Coverage"): a two-terminal-well CMOS stack
(one drawn well layer splitting NMOS/PMOS, contact/local-interconnect up
through one or two metal levels), not a full PDK's device zoo. Both decks
are defined in `src/klayout_tools/decks/sky130.py` /
`src/klayout_tools/decks/gf180mcu.py` as an `ExtractionDeck` (layer roles:
`active`, `poly`, `nwell`, optional `tap`, `contact`, an ordered `metals`
stack with matching `metal_labels`/`vias`, and an optional `well_label`) —
each field's exact layer numbers and provenance are documented in the deck
module's own docstring, verified against this repo's real corpus fixtures
(`tests/corpus/sky130/`, `tests/corpus/gf180mcu/`).

Two known connectivity-fidelity limitations, both documented in the deck
modules and deliberate (not oversights):

- **NMOS body.** Neither curated deck draws a separate substrate/pwell
  layer, so there is no drawn tap geometry to derive a real net name from.
  The NMOS body terminal is tied to a global net (`vsubs` by default) via
  KLayout's `connect_global` instead of a real substrate-tap extraction.
- **PMOS body (gf180mcu only).** sky130's curated deck draws well taps on a
  *distinct* layer from transistor active (`tap.drawing`), so the well body
  net picks up its real name via that tap + an `nwell` pin label (verified
  against the sky130 corpus: the PMOS body of a real inverter cell extracts
  to the correct `VPB` pin). gf180mcu's curated layer set has no distinct
  tap layer (`Comp` is shared with the transistor active layer) and no
  well-label layer, so its PMOS body terminal is a floating, anonymous net.

Connecting a well region to *every* contact inside it (rather than only a
genuinely distinct tap region) is deliberately **not** done — the well is a
background region spanning the whole PMOS area, so a blanket rule like that
shorts every transistor terminal inside the well together. See
`ExtractionDeck`'s docstring in `src/klayout_tools/decks/__init__.py` for
the full reasoning.

## PDK resolution

`--pdk`/`--pdk-root` are **optional** and resolved through
`klayout_tools.pdk.find_pdk` — the same resolver `klt pdk find`/`klt pdk
env` use ([`docs/cli/pdk.md`](pdk.md)):

- Omit both — the default — and extraction runs entirely from the curated
  `--deck` table; no PDK install is touched or required. This matches `klt
  drc`'s CI posture: both commands are runnable with nothing installed
  beyond `pip install klayout`.
- Give either — an explicit `--pdk <variant>` and/or `--pdk-root <root>` —
  and the PDK is resolved before extraction runs; an unresolvable PDK
  (nothing found, or the named variant is absent) is an application error
  (exit 1), and the resolved `variant`/`root`/`version` are echoed in the
  response's `pdk` field for provenance.

## Verified compatible with `klt sim`'s netlist convention

Hard acceptance bar (Epic #153: "`klt extract` output feeds `klt sim`
unmodified"), verified directly against
[`docs/cli/sim.md`](sim.md) → "Netlist convention: a circuit body, not a
full deck" rather than asserted: the written SPICE file is a
`.SUBCKT <top> <pins…> … .ENDS <top>` circuit body with **no top-level
`.control`/`.end` card** — confirmed directly against KLayout's
`NetlistSpiceWriter` output (it never emits a top-level `.END` for a
single-circuit netlist) and exercised by `tests/test_extract.py`.

An extracted netlist is a *DUT* with no stimulus (nothing in a layout says
"this rail is 1.8 V"); it is consumed by `klt sim` the way any DUT is — a
thin testbench `.include`s the extracted file, instantiates the `.subckt`,
and adds the sources, and *that* testbench is the `klt sim` `netlist`.
`tests/test_extract.py`'s `test_extracted_netlist_feeds_klt_sim_unmodified`
exercises exactly this against a real sky130 corpus cell end to end (skipped
when `ngspice` is not installed).

## JSON schema (the contract)

**JSON is the API.** Human-readable text output is a courtesy; the JSON
schema below is the stable contract. Per the project's rules, **breaking
(renaming, removing, or retyping) a field is a breaking change**. New fields
may be added without breaking the contract, so consumers should ignore
unknown fields. See [`docs/json-contract.md`](../json-contract.md) for the
envelope shared across all `klt` commands (`schema_version`, error shape,
exit codes).

| `netlist_sha256`   | string                     | SHA-256 hex digest of the written netlist file.                                                        |
| `status`           | `"extracted"`              | Never `"error"` — a failed run does not emit this envelope at all (see Exit codes).                    |

The `devices[]`/`nets[]` report is a *convenience view* for agents that want
structure without re-parsing SPICE; the **netlist file at `netlist_path` is
the authoritative artifact**, and it is what a future `klt lvs` and `klt sim`
consume.

### `devices[]` entries

| Field    | Type                        | Description                                                                                    |
| -------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `name`   | string                      | The device's instance name in the written netlist (e.g. `"$1"`, matching the `M$1 ...` line).    |
| `class`  | string                      | The deck's device-class name (`"nfet"` / `"pfet"`).                                              |
| `nets`   | object\<string, string\|null\> | Terminal → net-name map: `"s"`, `"g"`, `"d"`, `"b"`. `null` only if a terminal has no connected net at all (never observed for `s`/`g`/`d` in this deck's extraction; `b` can be `null`-free but anonymous, see "Coverage"). |
| `params` | object\<string, number\>    | `"w_um"` / `"l_um"`, the extracted gate width/length in micrometres.                             |

`devices` is sorted by `name` for deterministic, diff-clean output.

### `nets[]` entries

| Field          | Type    | Description                                                                 |
| -------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `name`         | string  | The net's name in the written netlist (a labelled name, or an anonymous `$N`). |
| `pin`          | boolean | Whether this net is promoted to a top-cell pin (a named net at the top level). |
| `device_count` | integer | Number of device terminals connected to this net.                             |

`nets` is sorted by `name` for deterministic, diff-clean output.

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning                                                                                          |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0`  | Extraction succeeded, netlist written.                                                              |
| `1`  | Failed to run — bad file, unknown `--deck`, unresolvable PDK (when `--pdk`/`--pdk-root` given), missing/ambiguous top cell, or an engine error. |
| `2`  | Usage error (missing argument, bad `--format` value) — from argparse.                               |

There is no exit code `3` — unlike `klt drc`/`klt lvs`, there is no "ran but
found problems" outcome for extraction; it either produces a netlist or it
fails (matching `klt gen`'s reasoning for omitting a `3`).

On error (exit 1), a concise message is written to **stderr** and nothing is
written to stdout. No Python traceback is printed.

- `--format text` (default): a plain-text line prefixed `klt extract:`.
- `--format json`: the documented JSON error envelope (see
  [`docs/json-contract.md`](../json-contract.md)):

  ```json
  { "schema_version": 1, "error": { "command": "extract", "message": "unknown deck 'nope' (available: gf180mcu, sky130)" } }
  ```

## Out of scope

Parasitic (RC) extraction is explicitly deferred, per the phase 1 spike's
"Out of scope" section — this command extracts devices and connectivity
only, never interconnect resistance/capacitance. Netlist comparison
(`klt lvs`) is a separate, later phase; this command only produces the
layout-side netlist half of that comparison.
